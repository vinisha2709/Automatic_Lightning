# Automatic_Lightning
Automatic Room Lighting System is a microcontroller based project that automatically turn on or off the lights in a room. Electricity, being one of the most important resources, must be utilized carefully.

We often forget to switch off lights or fans when we leave a room. By using this system, we can intentionally forget about the lights as the system will automatically take care of them.

The digital World we are living in allows us to use different technologies to automatically perform certain tasks. Such automation is very useful in certain areas like energy consumption, reducing human efforts, improving standard of living etc.

The aim of this project is to automatically turn on or off the lights in a room by detecting the human movement. We implemented this project using 8051 Microcontroller and two Infrared (IR) sensors.

Since the job of the circuit is to turn on the light when someone enters the room and turn off the light when the last person leaves the room, the project has to internally count the number of visitors entering and leaving the room. Hence, the project acts as an Automatic Room Lighting System as well as Bidirectional Visitor Counter.
